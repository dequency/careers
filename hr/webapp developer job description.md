## Employment Type

Full time, in-house

## Location

Remote. You need to be available daily for at least four hours between Monday—Friday, 8 a.m.—3 p.m. US/Pacific.

## Job Responsibilities

Come join our young team in building the next generation of <https://app.dequency.io>; learn (and teach us) a thing or two along the way. Some of your responsibilities:

- Build web apps (mostly) and smart contracts (rarely) as we experiment in the web3 space
- Bring new development tool and process ideas
- Help define the products by working with _everyone_ in the company

We are looking for expertise from browser UI to devops, so if your skills fall somewhere in that spectrum, let's talk. We do prefer candidates who are more toward the front end of the stack.

### Tools We Use

- Semantic HTML
- CSS (we currently use [MUI](https://mui.com), but will switch to plain or Tailwind CSS styled components going forward)
- JavaScript: React, DOM APIs, Node APIs
- GitHub tools and GitHub Actions
- JWT-based single sign-on
- REST

### Must-Haves

- Modern JavaScript mastery (bonus if you're also a DOM API/React expert)
- Thorough understanding of how modern web apps work, with emphasis on production development experience of multi-service backends, API design, and user interface
- Rock-solid knowledge of fundamental and advanced Git operations, and multi-user experience with GitHub issues, PRs, and projects

### Good-to-Haves

- HTML and CSS mastery
- Devops related knowledge: build pipelines, Docker, CI/CD practices, how to move your way around a UNIX terminal
- Great at creating documentation and drawing diagrams to convince other people why our ideas are worth considering
- Hands-on experience with creating and deploying smart contracts

### How Engineering Works at Dequency

- You won't be handed a solution to implement, you'll be asked to solve a problem
- We work on weekly iterations
- We get together once a day to show off what we've done and help each other out
- We teach each other about what we've learned
- We always look for better ways

## What You'll Love About Dequency

- **We're humble.** We readily admit what we don't know, and are willing to listen to other people.
- **We value you as a person.** We expect everyone to show up and contribute, but we also honor that you're more than your job—we all deal with the unexpected in life, we all have times when we need more support.
- **We want you to recharge.** We know you'll do your best work if you're well rested and relaxed. We have a flexible time-off policy and we mean it.
- **We're an eclectic bunch.** We have a small and diverse group of folks, we'd love it if you bring new cultural, professional, or life experiences to the mix.
